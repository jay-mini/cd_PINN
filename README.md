# cd-PINN: Continuous Dependence Physics-Informed Neural Networks

## Overview

In this paper, we introduce a novel extension of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) called Continuous Dependence PINNs (cd-PINN). Our approach is inspired by established mathematical principles regarding the continuous dependence of solutions to ordinary differential equations (ODEs) on initial conditions and parameters.

## Key Features

- **Enhanced Generalization**: cd-PINN demonstrates exceptional generalization capabilities when solving ordinary differential equations across a wide range of initial conditions and parameters.
- **Superior Accuracy**: Our results indicate that cd-PINN achieves accuracy levels that are 1 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than traditional PINNs under untrained conditions.
- **Computational Efficiency**: Despite the enhanced accuracy, the training time for cd-PINN is comparable to that of standard PINNs, making it an efficient choice for practitioners.

## Applications

We showcase the effectiveness of cd-PINN through several examples, including:
- The Logistic model
- The Lotka-Volterra model
- Damped harmonic oscillators

These case studies highlight the robustness of cd-PINN in a variety of scenarios.
