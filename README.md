# cd-PINN

In this paper, inspired by the well-known mathematical statements on the continuous dependence of solutions to ordinary differential equations on initial values and parameters, we make a non-trivial extension of the physics-informed neural networks by incorporating additional information on the continuous dependence of solutions (abbreviated as cd-PINN). Our cd-PINN exhibits an outstanding generalization ability on solving ordinary differential equations with respect to diverse initial values and parameters. As demonstrated through novel examples like the Logistic model, the Lotka-Volterra model as well as damped harmonic oscillators, the accuracy of cd-PINN under those untrained conditions is usually 1-3 orders of magnitude higher than PINN. Meanwhile, the CPU time costed for training in two approaches are comparable.
